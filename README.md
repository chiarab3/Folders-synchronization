# Folders-synchronization

# Description:
The program folders_synchronization.py is written in Python and synchronizes two folders, the source and the replica. The synchronization is one-way, meaning that the replica folder is updated to match the source folder, but not vice versa. The synchronization is performed periodically and the file operations are logged to a file and to the console.
